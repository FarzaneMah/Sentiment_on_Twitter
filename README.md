# Work from Home_on_Twitter
Having fun with Twitter API
In this project I used Twitter API to look at the Work from Home Sentiment on Twitter:

When Covid-19 hit, most people were asked to work from home. I was curious to know how they think about it. So I tried to find out what they are tweeting about it. I also wanted to know if the sentiment about working from home differs in different parts of the world.

I think it is useful to know if people are willing to work from home because the sentiment about working from home can affect productivity and influence policy making, both during COVID-19 outbreak and after that.

This is an easy fun project if you are looking to work with API.
